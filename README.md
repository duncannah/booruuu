# booruuu - a browser-based imageboard viewer

## Warning: This project is a personal project, and is not aimed for general use, although this may change in the future.

This is an imageboard (booru) viewer that runs on the browser. Eliminates annoyances that are frequent when using imageboards, such as advertisements, ugly interfaces, intentional throttling, etc...

This is personal project mainly aimed for learning React, but it is possible that it becomes a general-purpose tool if there's enough interest.
